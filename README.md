#Challenge

An analysis was conducted to help analyze the success or failures of different stocks.  This focuses on the years 2017 and 2018 for 12 different stocks.  Total Daily Volumes and Returns were generated.  

In 2017, all but TERP had returns that were in the positive, with ENPH with a return of 129.5%.

However, in 2018, all but two had returns that were in the negative.  The results show that ENPH had a lower return compare to 2017, but still in 2018 it had a return of 81.9%.

This concludes with the suggestion to purchase stocks from ENPH as that stock positive returns in both years and the highest in 2017.
